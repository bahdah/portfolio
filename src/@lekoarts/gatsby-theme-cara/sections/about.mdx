## About
I have close to four years of academic experience (Graduating in 2020 December with CS degree) and 
one year of co-op/internship software engineering experiences. From my co-op/internships, 
I was exposed to a collaborative team in backend development, frontend development, unit testing, and regression testing.
I was also exposed to network analysis for security vulnerabilities, and research into deep learning models and datasets.

I love learning new programming languages and determined to keep improving my skills. I prefer working with a team and enjoy 
exchanging ideas with each other.
